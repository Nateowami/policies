# Security Policy

## Security is fundamental to us

Simple Finance Technology Corp., the creator of Simple, meets all industry standards to safeguard your data. We use a variety of methods to secure our network and servers as well as our software and web applications. Our data retention and business continuity plans are comprehensive and our employees maintain organizational security measures designed to keep your data safe.

## Network and server security

* Network infrastructure is segregated into levels of information classification with strict routing, firewalling, and access control links that separate each privilege level.
* Network infrastructure undergoes regular internal penetration testing audits that are augmented by semi-regular third-party audits.
* Our information security team performs regular software updates throughout the Simple infrastructure to remain up-to-date on software security patches.
* Card numbers, mag-stripe data, and security codes are handled in accordance with PCI Level-1 requirements.

## Software and web application security

* Web APIs and web pages are secured with 256-bit High Assurance SSL certificates.
* Simple's cloud infrastructure makes use of Multi-Factor Authentication.
* Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) encryption (AES 256) is used when storing sensitive customer data.
* All asymmetric keys use a minimum key length of 4,096 bits and symmetric keys use a minimum of 256 bits.
* All Customer Information is encrypted with strong Public Key encryption; private keys to decrypt this data are not kept in the production environment.
* Simple applications undergo regular internal source code audits. Internal audits are augmented by semi-regular third-party audits.
* Simple developers practice secure coding practices. All Simple code complies with various Secure Coding Standards, including OWASP and CLASP.

## Data retention & Disaster recovery

## Security research and disclosure process

Simple understands the devotion and effort that security work requires. As such, we encourage (and reward) the responsible disclosure of any vulnerabilities to us. Responsible disclosure means:

* Openly share the full details of any vulnerabilities with us.
* Do not announce or share the details of any vulnerabilities in any way with the public or other parties.
* Do not exploit the vulnerability except for purposes of demonstrating it to Simple personnel. Please contact security@simple.com if you are unsure of exploitability and we will work with you to verify it safely.
* Do not use the vulnerability to access, modify, harm, or otherwise alter any Simple (or its customers') data. Vulnerabilities that are “responsibly disclosed” according to the above process are welcomed. Simple will not seek to bring legal action against any person who adheres to this process of responsible disclosure. Additionally, severe vulnerabilities are eligible for a vulnerability reward.

Please report any vulnerabilities, security concerns, or security suggestions to security@simple.com.
