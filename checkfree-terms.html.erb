  <dd>
    <p>By providing us with names and account information of Billers to whom you wish to direct payments, you authorize us to follow the Payment Instructions that we receive through the payment system.

    <p>We will use reasonable efforts to make all your payments properly. However, we shall incur no liability and any Service Guarantee as set forth in the Section above entitled “Service Guarantee” above shall be void if we are unable to complete any payments initiated by you because of the existence of any one or more of the following circumstances:</p>

  <dt>5. PAYMENT CANCELLATION REQUESTS</dt>
  <dd>You may cancel or edit any Scheduled Payment (including recurring payments) by following the directions within the application. There is no charge for canceling or editing a Scheduled Payment. Once the Service has begun processing a payment it cannot be cancelled or edited, therefore a stop payment request must be submitted.</dd>

We may also not have a reasonable opportunity to act on any stop payment request after a payment has been processed.

We will notify your electronic Biller(s) as to the change in status of your account and it is your sole responsibility to make arrangements for an alternative form of bill delivery. We will not be responsible for presenting any Electronic Bills that are already in process at the time of cancellation.</dd>

  <dt>11. NON-DELIVERY OF ELECTRONIC BILLS(S)</dt>

  <dd>If you believe your password or other means of access to your eBill Payment Services account (or Payment Account) has been lost or stolen, you should notify us at once in accordance with the methods described in Section C.22. If you tell us within two (2) Business Days after you discover your password or other means to access the eBill Payment Services has been lost or stolen, your liability is no more than $50.00 should someone access your eBill Payment Services account (or Payment Account) without your permission. If you do not tell us within two (2) Business Days after you learn of such loss or theft, and we can prove that we could have prevented the unauthorized use of your password or other means to access your eBill Payment Services account (or Payment Account) if you had told us, you could be liable for as much as $500.00. If your monthly bank statement associated with your Payment Account contains transfers through the eBill Payment Services that you did not authorize, you must tell us at once. If you do not tell us within sixty (60) days after the statement was sent to you, you may lose any amount transferred through the eBill Payment Services without your authorization after the sixty (60) days if we can demonstrate that we could have stopped someone from taking such funds had you told us in time.

  <dt>14. FAILED OR RETURNED TRANSACTIONS</dt>
  <dd>In using the Services, you are requesting us to make payments for you from your Payment Account.

If the claiming party selects non-appearance-based arbitration, the parties agree that the following rules shall apply: (i) the arbitration may be conducted telephonically, and/or online, or be based solely on written submissions, at the election of the party commencing the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration shall not require any travel or personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (iii) discovery shall not be permitted.
c) When we or you (whoever is the party commencing arbitration) do not select non-appearance-based procedures, the parties agree that there shall be no discovery except whatever discovery the arbitrator determines is necessary for fair resolution of the claim or dispute.
d) Neither we nor you shall seek any award of attorney's fees in any arbitration claim arising under or relating to this Agreement, except that the arbitrator may award attorney's fees when (and only to the extent that) the applicable law requires an award of attorney's fees to the prevailing party.
</dd>

<dt>15. Arbitrability. Issues to Be Decided By Arbitrator.</dt>
<dd>The Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.</dd>
