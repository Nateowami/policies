<h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>

<h3>Definitions for the Simple Prepaid Visa&reg; Card</h3>
<p>This document constitutes the agreement ("Agreement") outlining the terms and conditions under which the Simple Prepaid Visa Card has been issued to you. By accepting and using the Card, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement. "Card" means the Simple Prepaid Visa Card issued to you by The Bancorp Bank, Wilmington, Delaware. "Issuer" means The Bancorp Bank or its depository institution affiliate. The Issuer is an FDIC insured member institution. "Card Account" means the records we maintain to account for the value of claims associated with the Card. "You" and "your" mean the person or persons who have received the Card and are authorized to use the Card as provided for in this Agreement. "We," "us," and "our" mean the Issuer, our successors, affiliates or assignees. You acknowledge and agree that the value available in the Card Account is limited to the funds that you have loaded into the Card Account or have been loaded into the Card Account on your behalf. You agree to sign the back of the Card immediately upon receipt. The expiration date of the Card is identified on the front of your Card. The Card is a prepaid card. The Card is not connected in any way to any other account. The Card is not a credit card. The Card is not for resale. You will not receive any interest on your funds in the Card Account. The Card will remain the property of the Issuer and must be surrendered upon demand.

The Card is not designed for business use, and we may close your Card if we determine that it is being used for business purposes. We may refuse to process any transaction that we believe may violate the terms of this Agreement. Our business days are Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays, even if we are open.</p>

<p>Write down your Card number and the customer service phone number provided in this Agreement on a separate piece of paper in case your Card is lost, stolen, or destroyed. Please read this Agreement carefully and keep it for future reference.</p>

<h3>Obtaining Your Card</h3>
<p>The USA PATRIOT Act is a federal law that requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens a Card Account. What this means for you: When you open a Card Account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to reasonably identify you. We may also ask to see your driverâ€™s license or other identifying documents at any time.</p>

<h3>Authorized Users</h3>
<p>You are responsible for all authorized transactions initiated and fees incurred by use of your Card. If you permit another person to have access to your Card or Card number, we will treat this as if you have authorized such use and you will be liable for all transactions and fees incurred by those persons. You are wholly responsible for the use of each Card according to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Secondary Cardholder</h3>
<p>You may not request an additional Card for another person.</p>

<h3>Activation</h3>
<p>You must activate your Card before it can be used. You may activate your Card by calling 888-248-5068. You will need to provide personal information in order to verify your identity.</p>

<h3>Personal Identification Number</h3>
<p>You will not receive a Personal Identification Number ("PIN") with your Card Account. However, you will be requested to select a PIN when you activate your Card. You should not write or keep your PIN with your Card. Never share your PIN with anyone. When entering your PIN, be sure it cannot be observed by others and do not enter your PIN into any terminal that appears to be modified or suspicious. If you believe that anyone has gained unauthorized access to your PIN, you should advise us immediately following the procedures in the paragraph labeled "Your Liability for Unauthorized Transfers." To activate your card you will need provide us with your social security number.</p>

<h3>Cash Access</h3>
<p>With your PIN, you may use your Card to obtain cash from any Automated Teller Machine ("ATM") or any Point-of-Sale ("POS") device, as permissible by the merchant, that bears the Visa&reg;, Interlink&reg;, Plus&reg; or Allpoint Acceptance Marks. All ATM transactions are treated as cash withdrawal transactions. You may use your Card at an ATM. The maximum cumulative amount that can be withdrawn from an ATM per day per twenty-four (24) hour period is $500.00. The maximum cumulative amount that can be withdrawn from an ATM per month is $5,000.00. The maximum you can withdraw per twenty-four (24) hour period through a participating bank (over the counter withdrawal) is $7,500.00 in the United States and $5,000.00 outside of the United States. Any funds withdrawn from a POS device will be subject to the maximum amount of $25,000.00 that can be spent on your Card per 30 day period. Any funds withdrawn from a POS device or through a participating bank (over the counter withdrawal) will be subject to the maximum amount that can be spent on your Card per 30 day period.</p>

<h3>Loading Your Card</h3>
<p>You may add funds to your Card, called "value loading", at any time. The minimum amount of the initial value load is $0.01. The minimum amount of each value reload is $0.01. The maximum amount of the initial value load is $30,000. The maximum amount of each value reload is $30,000. The maximum number of times you may load your Card per day is three (3). You may add value or load your Card via Direct Deposit. A Direct Deposit enrolment form is provided to you in your welcome package, or on the website at www.simple.com, or by calling customer service toll free at 1-888-248-0632 (if calling from outside the US, please call 1-424-652-5294). You will have access to your funds by 10:00 am ET on your deposit date. Personal checks, cashiers checks, and money orders sent to the Issuer are not an acceptable form of loading. All checks and money orders sent to the Issuer for Card loading will be returned unless the full amount may be applied towards a negative balance, in which case the check or money order may or may not be loaded to the Card at the discretion of the Issuer.</p>

<h3>Direct Deposit Account</h3>
<p>Your prepaid Card Account and associated direct deposit account number cannot be used for preauthorized direct debits from merchants or from utility or Internet service providers. If presented for payment, these preauthorized direct debits will be declined and your payment to the merchant or provider will not be processed. The bank routing number and direct deposit account number are for the purpose of initiating direct deposits to your prepaid Card Account only. You are not authorized to provide this bank routing number and direct deposit account number to anyone other than your employer or payer.</p>

<h3>Using Your Card/Features</h3>
<p>The maximum amount that can be used for the purchase of goods and services on your Card per twenty-four (24) hour period is $3,000.00. The maximum value of your card is restricted to $30,000.</p>
<p>You may use your Card to purchase or lease goods or services wherever Visa Debit Cards are accepted as long as you do not exceed the value available on your Card Account. Some merchants do not allow cardholders to conduct split transactions where you would use the Card as partial payment for goods and services and pay the remainder of the balance with another form of legal tender. If you wish to conduct a split transaction and it is permitted by the merchant, you must tell the merchant to charge only the exact amount of funds available on the Card to the Card. You must then arrange to pay the difference using another payment method. Some merchants may require payment for the remaining balance in cash. If you fail to inform the merchant that you would like to complete a split transaction prior to swiping your Card, your Card is likely to be declined or refused.</p>
<p>If you use your Card at an automated fuel dispenser ("pay at the pump"), the merchant may preauthorize the transaction amount up to $100.00 or more. If your Card is declined, even though you have sufficient funds available, pay for your purchase inside with the cashier. If you use your Card at a restaurant, a hotel, for a car rental purchase, or for similar purchases, the merchant may preauthorize the transaction amount for the purchase amount plus up to 20% or more to ensure there are sufficient funds available to cover tips or incidental expenses incurred. Any preauthorization amount will place a "hold" on your available funds until the merchant sends us the final payment amount of your purchase. Once the final payment amount is received, the preauthorization amount on hold will be removed. It may take up to seven (7) days for the hold to be removed. During the hold period, you will not have access to the preauthorized amount.</p>
<p>If you use your Card number without presenting your Card (such as for a mail order, telephone, or Internet purchase), the legal effect will be the same as if you used the Card itself. For security reasons, we may limit the amount or number of transactions you can make on your Card. Your Card cannot be redeemed for cash. You cannot use your Card for online gambling or any illegal transaction.</p>
<p>Each time you use your Card, you authorize us to reduce the value available in your Card Account by the amount of the transaction and any applicable fees. You are not allowed to exceed the available amount in your Card Account through an individual transaction or a series of transactions. Nevertheless, if a transaction exceeds the balance of the funds available on your Card, you shall remain fully liable to us for the amount of the transaction and any applicable fees.</p>
<p>You do not have the right to stop payment on any purchase or payment transaction originated by use of your Card. You cannot make preauthorized regular payments from your Card Account. If you authorize a transaction and then fail to make a purchase of that item as planned, the approval may result in a hold for that amount of funds for up to thirty (30) days. Transactions at certain merchants especially, car rentals and hotels, may result in a hold for that amount of funds for up to sixty (60) days.</p>

<h3>Non-Visa Debit Transactions</h3>
<p>New procedures are in effect that may impact you when you use your Card at certain merchant locations. In the past, transactions have been processed as Visa debit transactions unless you entered a PIN. Now, if you do not enter a PIN, transactions may be processed as either a Visa debit transaction or as a STAR transaction.</p>
<p>Merchants are responsible for and must provide you with a clear way of choosing to make a Visa debit transaction if they support the option. Please be advised that should you choose to use STAR network when making a transaction without a PIN, different terms may apply. Certain protections and rights applicable only to Visa debit transactions as described in this Agreement will not apply to transactions processed on the STAR network. Please refer to the paragraph labeled "Your Liability for Unauthorized Transfers" for a description of these rights and protections applicable to Visa debit and non-Visa debit transactions.</p>
<p>To initiate a Visa debit transaction at the POS, swipe your Card through a POS terminal, sign the receipt, or provide your Card number for a mail order, telephone, or Internet purchase. To initiate a non-Visa debit transaction at the POS, enter your PIN at the POS terminal or provide your Card number after clearly indicating a preference to route your transaction as a non-Visa debit transaction for certain bill payment, mail order, telephone, or Internet purchases.</p>

<h3>Returns and Refunds</h3>
<p>If you are entitled to a refund for any reason for goods or services obtained with your Card, you agree to accept credits to your Card for such refunds and agree to the refund policy of that merchant. If you have a problem with a purchase that you made with your Card, or if you have a dispute with the merchant, you must handle it directly with the merchant.</p>

<h3>Card Expiration</h3>
<p>Your Card will expire on the date indicated on its face. A new card will be issued to you 30 days before the current card expires. If there are any funds remaining on the Card after expiration, they will automatically be transferred to the new stored value card upon activation of the new card. If you have questions regarding the funds remaining on your Card, write us at the address listed below. An administrative fee may be charged to close your Card.</p>

<h3>Card Replacement</h3>
<p>If you need to replace your Card for any reason, please contact us toll-free at 1-888-248-0632 (if calling from outside the US, please call 1-424-652-5294) to request a replacement Card. You will be required to provide personal information which may include your Card number, full name, transaction history, etc. There is a $2.00 fee for replacing your Card.</p>

<h3>Charges Made In Foreign Currencies</h3>
<p>If you engage in a transaction in a currency other than U.S. dollars using your Card, then Visa International will convert the charge into a U.S. dollar amount. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is either (a) a rate selected by Visa from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives, or (b) the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The currency conversion rate for the processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the date of the transaction or the date the transaction is posted to your billing statement.</p>
<p>For each purchase transaction in a foreign currency that has been converted into a U.S. dollar amount by Visa, the Issuer may assess a foreign currency conversion fee of 3% of the transaction amount and will retain this amount as compensation and will retain this amount for its services.
</p>

<h3>Receipts</h3>
<p>You should get a receipt at the time you make a transaction using your Card. You agree to retain, verify, and reconcile your transactions and receipts.</p>

<h3>Card Account Balance/Periodic Statements</h3>
<p>You are responsible for keeping track of your Card Account available balance. Merchants generally will not be able to determine your available balance. It's important to know your available balance before making any transaction. You may obtain information about the amount of money you have remaining in your Card Account by receiving account alerts from us, or by calling us toll free at 1-888-248-0632 (if calling from outside the US, please call 1-424-652-5294). This information, along with a sixty (60) day history of Card Account transactions, is also available online at www.simple.com. You also have a right to obtain a sixty (60) day written history of Card Account transactions by calling us toll free at 1-888-248-0632 (if calling from outside the US, please call 1-424-652-5294) or by writing us at Simple Customer Service, PO Box 111, Presque Isle, ME 04769. You will not automatically receive paper statements. However, paper statements can be requested on a case-by-case basis. There is a $5.00 fee per statement for this service.</p>


<h3>Fee Schedule </h3>
<p>All fee amounts will be withdrawn from your Card Account and will be assessed as long as there is a remaining balance on your Card Account, except where prohibited by law. Anytime your remaining Card Account balance is less than the fee amount being assessed, the balance of your Card Account will be applied to the fee amount.</p>

<p>If you use an ATM not owned by us for any transaction, including a balance inquiry, you may be charged a fee by the ATM operator even if you do not complete a withdrawal. This ATM fee is a third party fee amount assessed by the individual ATM operator only and is not assessed by us. This ATM fee amount will be charged to your Card.</p>

<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
<p>We may disclose information to third parties about your Card or the transactions you make:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Where it is necessary for completing transactions;</li>
  <li>In order to verify the existence and condition of your Card for a third party, such as merchant;</li>
  <li>In order to comply with government agency, court order, or other legal reporting requirements;</li>
  <li>If you give us your written permission; or</li>
  <li>To our employees, auditors, affiliates, service providers, or attorneys as needed. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Our Liability for Failure to Complete Transactions</h3>
<p>If we do not properly complete a transaction from your Card on time or in the correct amount according to our Agreement with you, we will be liable for your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. We will not be liable, for instance:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If through no fault of ours, you do not have enough funds available on your Card to complete the transaction;</li>
  <li>If a merchant refuses to accept your Card;</li>
  <li>If an ATM where you are making a cash withdrawal does not have enough cash;</li>
  <li>If an electronic terminal where you are making a transaction does not operate properly, and you knew about the problem when you initiated the transaction;</li>
  <li>If access to your Card has been blocked after you reported your Card lost or stolen;</li>
  <li>If there is a hold or your funds are subject to legal process or other encumbrance restricting their use;</li>
  <li>If we have reason to believe the requested transaction is unauthorized;</li>
  <li>If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire, flood, or computer or communication failure) prevent the completion of the transaction, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken; or</li>
  <li>Any other exception stated in our Agreement with you.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Your Liability for Unauthorized Transfers</h3>
<p>Contact us AT ONCE if you believe your Card has been lost or stolen, or of any unauthorized transactions. Telephoning is the best way to minimize your possible losses. If you believe your Card has been lost or stolen, or that someone has transferred or may transfer money from your Card Account without your permission, call us toll free at 1-888-248-0632 (if calling from outside the U.S., please call 1-424-652-5294.) Under Visa International Operating Regulations, your liability for unauthorized Visa debit transactions on your Card Account that take place on the Visa system is Zero dollars ($0.00), unless we determine that you were grossly negligent or fraudulent in the handling of your Card. We may require you to provide a written statement regarding claims of unauthorized VISA point of sale transactions. This reduced liability does not apply to PIN transactions not processed by Visa or to ATM transactions.</p>
<p>For PIN transactions not processed by VISA and for ATM transactions, if you believe your Card has been lost or stolen and you tell us within  two (2) business days after you learn of the loss or theft, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your Card without your permission. If you do not notify us within two (2) business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Card and we can prove that we could have stopped someone from using your Card without your permission if you had promptly notified us, you could lose as much as $500.00. If your Card has been lost or stolen, we will close you Card Account to keep your losses down.</p>
<p>Also, if you become aware of and/or your statement shows transactions that you did not make, tell us at once. If you do not tell us within sixty (60) days after the statement was mailed to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the sixty (60) days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us on time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we may extend the time periods. If your Card has been lost or stolen, we will close you Card Account to keep your losses down.</p>

<h3>Other Terms </h3>
<p>Your Card and your obligations under this Agreement may not be assigned.  We may transfer our rights under this Agreement.  Use of your Card is subject to all applicable rules and customs of any clearinghouse or other association involved in transactions.  We do not waive our rights by delaying or failing to exercise them at anytime.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any rule, law, or regulation of any governmental agency, local, state, or federal, the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement shall not be affected.  This Agreement will be governed by the law of the State of Delaware except to the extent governed by federal law.</p>

<h3>Right of Setoff</h3>
<p>Subject to applicable law, we may exercise our right of setoff or security interest against any and all of your Card Accounts (except IRA, Keogh plan and Trust Accounts) without notice, for any liability or debt of any of you, whether joint or individual, whether direct or contingent, whether now or hereafter existing, and whether arising from overdrafts, endorsements, guarantees, loans, attachments, garnishments, levies, attorneysâ€™ fees, or other obligations. If the Account is a joint or multiple-party account, each joint or multiple-party account holder authorizes us to exercise our right of setoff against any and all Accounts of each Account Holder.</p>

<h3>Amendment and Cancellation</h3>
<p>We may amend or change the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time pursuant to applicable law.  You will be notified of any change in the manner provided by such law prior to the effective date of the change.  However, if the change is made for security purposes, we can implement such change without prior notice.  We may cancel or suspend your Card or this Agreement at any time.  You may cancel this Agreement by returning the Card to us.  Your termination of this Agreement will not affect any of our rights or your obligations arising under this Agreement prior to termination. </p>
<p>In the event that your Card Account is cancelled, closed, or terminated for any reason, you may request the unused balance to be returned to you via a check to the mailing address we have in our records. There is a $5.00 fee for this service. The Issuer reserves the right to refuse to return any unused balance amount less than $1.00.</p>
