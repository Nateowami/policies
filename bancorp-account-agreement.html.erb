<h2>Deposit Account Terms and Disclosures</h2>

<p>For purposes of this Agreement and any other account-related documents, the term "<span class="underline">Deposit Account</span>" means any <abbr title="Negotiable Order of Withdrawal">NOW</abbr> account opened at the Bank through the Simple Web site or any method offered by the Bank.</p>

<div id="s-2.1">
  <div id="s-2.1.1">
    <h4>Accepting Deposits</h4>

    <p>All items deposited will be handled by us as agent for you. Items sent for deposit shall not be construed to have been received by the Bank until we have received the actual item. For checks submitted via mobile deposit, the check shall not be construed to have been received by the Bank until the Bank receives the valid electronic check image file. We have the right to refuse any deposit. We may not accept deposits in foreign funds or checks drawn on banks located outside of the United States. If we do choose to accept foreign checks, the items are subject to collection prior to being credited to your account.</p>

    <p>We may disregard any information written or printed on a check other than the signature of the drawer, the identification of the bank on which the check is drawn, the name of the payee, and the electronically encoded routing information on the check.</p>

    <p>The Bank may return or refuse to accept all or any part of a deposit or credit to an account at any time, and will not be liable to the Customer for doing so, even if such action causes outstanding items to be dishonored and returned, or payment orders to be rejected. Refused deposits will be returned to the Customer.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.1.2">
    <h4>Receipt of Deposits</h4>

    <p>All transactions received after our daily cut-off time on a business day we are open, or received on a day on which we are not open for business, will be treated and recorded as if received on the next business day that we are open. Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays are not considered business days. All checks, drafts and other items are conditionally credited to your account in U.S. dollars and are subject to our receipt of final payment for each item. We assume no responsibility for collections beyond the exercise of reasonable care. For deposited items, we are not responsible for the negligence of our correspondent banks or for the loss of "in transit" items.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.1.3">
    <h4>Cash Deposits</h4>

    <p>Please do not send cash deposits through the mail. In the event that cash deposits are received, you agree that the Bank's determination of the amount of the deposit will be final. The Bank is not liable for any deposits, including cash, lost in the mail, lost in transit, or not received by the Bank.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.1.4">
    <h4>Mobile Deposit</h4>

    <p>Mobile deposit allows you to make deposits to your account remotely by taking a picture of your check(s) and transmitting images of such checks to us in compliance with our requirements. If we accept the image for collection, we will then attempt to collect the item by presenting the image or converting the image to a substitute check. Unlike traditional check deposits as discussed above, you retain the original paper check when you use mobile deposit. The manner in which these substitute checks or images are cleared, presented for payment and collected will be determined by us in our sole discretion. We may change, modify, add or remove functionality from mobile deposit at any time, with or without notice to you.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.1.5">
    <h4>Mobile Deposit Eligibility; Termination of Account Relationship</h4>

    <p>We will determine whether you are eligible for the mobile deposit feature in our sole discretion. If you violate the terms of the mobile deposit feature, then we also may use such actions as a basis to terminate your account relationship with us.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.1.6">
    <h4>Endorsement Requirements</h4>

    <p>For any check deposited as an image through mobile deposit, you must endorse the check by signing or stamping the back and writing "For deposit only via mobile deposit, Bank Account #____" or as otherwise instructed by us before you scan the check.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.1.7">
    <h4 id="limits">Limits</h4>

    <p>We may impose limits on the dollar amount or number of deposits you make through mobile deposit, and we may change such limits at any time at our discretion. These limits are $3,000 per check ($2,000 first 30 days) with a daily maximum of $5,000 and no more than 5 per day. There can be no more than 10 checks per week with a total of $25,000, or 15 checks not to exceed $75,000. Limits may be changed based on the length of time the account is opened and account activity.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.1.8">
    <h4>Prohibited Checks</h4>

    <p>We may decline to accept any image of a check you submit through mobile deposit at our sole discretion. You agree that you will not scan and attempt to deposit any of the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Checks payable to any person or entity other than you (i.e., third party checks);</li>

        <li>Travelers checks and savings bonds;</li>
        <li>Non-negotiable instruments, such as promissory notes; or</li>
        <li>Checks drawn on any of your account(s) at The Bancorp Bank;</li>
        <li>Starter checks or counter checks (checks from a teller window).
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.1.9">
    <h4>Accountholder's Warranties</h4>

    <p>I will comply with all applicable rules, laws and regulations. Each time you scan and submit check images for deposit through the mobile deposit feature, you also make all the warranties set forth in and subject to the terms of the Delaware Uniform Commercial Code ("<span class="underline"><abbr title="Uniform Commercial Code">UCC</abbr></span>") for the image as if it were an item subject to the terms of the UCC. I make the following warranties and representations with respect to each image of an original check I transmit to you using the Services:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Each image of a check transmitted to you is a true and accurate rendition of the front and back of the original check at the time that it was scanned, without any alteration, and the drawer of the check has no defense against payment of the check.</li>
        <li>The amount, the payee, signature(s), and endorsement(s) on the original check are legible, genuine, and accurate.</li>
        <li>I will not deposit, re-present, negotiate, seek to negotiate or otherwise endorse to a third party the original check and no person will receive a transfer, presentment, or return of, or otherwise be charged for, the item (either the original item, or a paper or electronic representation of the original item) such that the person will be asked to make payment based on an item it has already paid.</li>
        <li>I will only transmit eligible checks and items that I am entitled to enforce.</li>
        <li>All checks and items will include all signatures required for their negotiation.</li>
        <li>I will use the Services only for my own deposits and will not allow the use of the Service for the benefit of any third party.</li>
        <li>Other than the digital image of an original check that I remotely deposit through your Services, there are no other duplicate images of the original check.</li>
        <li>I have possession of each original check deposited using the Services and no party will submit the original check for payment.</li>
        <li>I have ensured that each original check was authorized by the drawer in the amount stated on the original check and to the payee stated on the original check.</li>
        <li>I am authorized to enforce each item transmitted or am authorized to obtain payment of each item on behalf of a person entitled to enforce such transmitted item.</li>
        <li>The information I provided for my Simple account remains true and accurate; and in the event any such information changes, I will immediately notify you of the change.</li>
        <li>I have not failed to communicate any material information to you.</li>
        <li>Files and images transmitted to you will contain no viruses or any other disabling features that may have an adverse impact on your network, data, or related systems.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.1.10">
    <h4>Receipt of Check</h4>

    <p>We are not responsible for check images we do not receive or that are dropped during transmission. A check image will be deemed received by us only when we provide an online confirmation receipt to you that we have received your check image. When we confirm receipt of your check image, the image will still be subject to review before we submit it for collection and may still be rejected for any reason in our sole discretion. A confirmation is not a representation, warranty or other indication that the check image will be presented for collection or will be honored by any collecting or paying bank. If we reject a check image received through the mobile deposit feature, then you may submit the original check by mail to us for processing unless we instruct you otherwise, or you may want to contact the drawer and have them reissue the check. If you do submit the original check for processing, we reserve the right to refuse to process it and may instead require you to have the check reissued.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.1.11">
    <h4>Retention of Original Check</h4>

    <p>Once your check image has been credited to your account you must mark the original check as "VOID" and retain the check for 60 days. You may not present the original check or any image or substitute check created from the original check for payment at any other financial institution. During this 60-day period, you must store the original paper check securely using precautions at least as secure as those you would use to protect a blank check, and you must make the original paper check available to us for review at any time and as necessary for us to facilitate the clearing and collection process, to address third-party claims or for our own audit purposes. Should you fail to produce the original paper check, you authorize us to deduct the amount of the check in question from your account, regardless of whether such action may cause your account to not have sufficient funds, and to pay any associated fees. Immediately after this 60-day period, you must destroy the original paper check.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.1.12">
    <h4>Maintenance</h4>

    <p>Maintenance to the Service may be performed from time-to-time resulting in interrupted service, delays or errors in the Service and we shall have no liability for any such interruptions, delays or errors. Attempts to provide prior notice of scheduled maintenance will be made, but we cannot guarantee that such notice will be provided.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.1.13">
    <h4>Indemnification</h4>
    <p>In addition to the other indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, damages, liabilities, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) or other loss that arises from or relates to your use of mobile deposit or your breach of the representations, warranties or covenants set forth in these Terms, including, without limitation, your attempt to duplicate the presentation of a check image via presentation of the original check or an image or substitute check derived from the original check and any liability that we may incur for processing an image or substitute check rather than the original paper check.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.1.14">
    <h4>Third-Party Checks</h4>

    <p>All checks deposited must be payable to you; the Bank will not accept third-party checks. In the event that the Bank receives and detects a third-party check, the Bank will not deposit the check into any account at the Bank. Third-party checks received in our Operation Center will be returned to you through the U.S. mail, and the Bank will not be liable for any checks that may become lost in the mail. Third Party checks deposited through mobile deposit may be rejected in processing. The Bank reserves the right to reject a deposit if it is made payable to the Bank and contains no means to identify the account to which it should be credited.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.1.15">
    <h4>Automated Clearing House Deposits</h4>

    <p>In order to transfer funds from an account that you own or have control of at another financial institution to your account at the Bank using the Automated Clearing House ("<span class="underline"><abbr title="Automated Clearing House">ACH</abbr></span>") Funds Transfer service, the Bank may require additional documentation or verification before activating this service.</p>

    <p><abbr title="Automated Clearing House">ACH</abbr> transactions will not be processed and accessible until the <abbr title="Automated Clearing House">ACH</abbr> service is activated by the Bank, upon receipt and review of the requested documentation or verification.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.1.16">
    <h4>Endorsements</h4>

    <p>You will endorse any check or other item submitted for deposit exactly as it was made payable to you. You warrant that all endorsements on items deposited to your account are genuine. Any endorsement must be placed in the one-inch area starting at the left side on the back of an item and the remaining area on the back of the item may not contain any preprinted, stamped or handwritten information. If you fail to do this, you may be required to reimburse us for losses incurred. For any check deposited as an image through mobile deposit, you must endorse the check by signing or stamping the back and writing "For deposit only via mobile deposit, Bank Account #____" or as otherwise instructed by us before you scan the check. In the absence of endorsement, you authorize us to supply any missing endorsements if items are made payable to you or your order and you have not endorsed them.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.1.17">
    <h4>Deposited Items Returned</h4>

    <p>If final payment is not received on any item you deposited to your account, or if any direct deposit, <abbr title="Automated Clearing House">ACH</abbr> deposit or Electronic Fund Transfer to your account is returned to us for any reason, you agree to pay us the amount of the return. We may charge any account of which you are an owner, or re-present any item you deposit with us that is returned to us unpaid, without prior notice to you. We may adjust any accrued interest on your account, and we may charge a fee for returned deposited items in accordance with our <strong><a href="/policies/schedule-of-fees/">Schedule of Fees</a></strong>.</p>

    <p>You authorize us to attempt collection of previously returned items that you deposited. In our attempts to collect these items, you agree that we may allow the payor bank (the bank on which the item is drawn) to hold the item beyond its midnight deadline. If an item you deposit is returned unpaid, you waive the requirement for notice of this return.</p>

    <p>If a claim is made on any item subsequent to final payment on the grounds that the item was altered, bears a forged or unauthorized endorsement, or was not otherwise properly payable, we may withhold credit for the item from your account until final determination of the claim. In addition, we will not be liable for a check, draft or other item that you deposit that has been forged or altered in such a way that a reasonable person could not discover the forgery.</p>

    <p>You understand that we may convert items you deposit through mobile deposit into substitute checks, images, or <abbr title="Automated Clearing House">ACH</abbr> entries. As a result, in the event that your item is returned unpaid, you will only receive a copy of the substitute check or image, or in the case of <abbr title="Automated Clearing House">ACH</abbr> entries, the <abbr title="Automated Clearing House">ACH</abbr> information.</p>

    <h4>Disputes over Account Funds</h4>

    <p>The Bank may refuse to pay out any money from an account until any dispute over the deposits or funds (including, without limitation, any dispute over what persons are authorized to represent or act for the Customer) has been resolved by a court or by agreement of the parties that is documented to the Bank's satisfaction. The Bank may file an action in interpleader with respect to any money where the Bank has been notified of disputed claims to that money. If any person asserts that a dispute exists, the Bank is not required to determine whether that dispute has merit in order to refuse to pay funds or interplead the funds. The Customer agrees to reimburse the Bank for any expenses, including legal and attorneys' fees, that the Bank incurs because of any dispute.</p>

  <h3>Withdrawals from Accounts</h3>

  <div id="s-2.2.1">
    <h4>General</h4>

    <p>The specified account owner may withdraw or transfer all or any part of the account balance at any time on forms approved by us or with your Card.</p>

    <p>The fact that we may honor withdrawal requests that overdraw the account balance does not obligate us to do so, unless required by law. Withdrawals will first be made from available funds, and we may, unless prohibited by law or our written policy, refuse any withdrawal request against unavailable funds, even if our general practice is to the contrary. We reserve the right to refuse any withdrawal or transfer request that is attempted by any method not specifically permitted, or that exceeds any frequency limitations. Even if we honor a nonconforming request, repeated abuse of the stated limitations (if any) may eventually force us to close the account. We will use the date a transaction is completed by us (as opposed to the day you initiated it) to apply the frequency limitations.</p>

<div id="s-2.3">
  <h3>General Account Information</h3>

  <div id="s-2.3.1">
    <h4>Account Transfer</h4>

    <p>Your account(s) may not be transferred or reassigned without our prior written consent.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.3.2">
    <h4>Direct Deposits</h4>

    <p>If, in connection with a direct deposit plan, we deposit any amount into your account that should have been returned to the federal government for any reason, you authorize us to deduct the amount of our liability to the federal government from your account or from any other account you have with us, without prior notice and at any time, except as prohibited by law. We may also use any other legal remedy to recover the amount of our liability.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.3.3">
    <h4>Right of Set Off</h4>

    <p>If you owe us money or are past due on any obligation to us, we can use the funds in any of your accounts with us to repay the amount you owe us, without going through any legal process or court proceeding. In other words, we reserve the right to set off any liability - primary or secondary, direct or contingent, past, present or future, sole or joint - that you owe to us, against any individual or joint Deposit Account you have with us. To the extent that we charge your account, we are relieved from any liability in connection with the funds we use. Further, you grant us a lien on and security interest in the funds on deposit in each of your accounts as security for all of your liabilities and obligations to us, now or in the future. We will notify you if we have exercised our right of set off.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.3.4">
    <h4>Statements</h4>

    <p>You agree to examine and reconcile your periodic statement upon receipt and promptly notify us by telephone or through the Simple Web site of any discrepancy or the unauthorized payment of any item. If you fail to do so, you will have to either bear the loss yourself or share the loss with us (depending on whether we used appropriate care and/or whether we in any significant way contributed to the loss). You agree that you will examine your statement with care within a reasonable period of time not to exceed 30 days from when the statement is first sent or made available to you.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.3.5">
    <h4>Investigation of Claims</h4>

    <p>If you fail to discover or notify us of any unauthorized signature, forgery or alteration on the face or back of the check or any unauthorized draft or item on your account within 30 days after the monthly statement is made available to you, you cannot make any claim against us with respect to the check, draft, or item. In addition, we are not liable for an item that has been forged or altered in such a way that a reasonable person could not discover the forgery or alteration. You are in the best position to detect an unauthorized signature, a forged endorsement, a material alteration, an unauthorized paper draft or any unauthorized item on your account.</p>

    <p>If you notify us of an unauthorized signature, forgery or alteration on the face or back of any check, any unauthorized paper draft, or any unauthorized item on your account within the time period required by the terms of this disclosure, we may investigate your claim for up to 60 days after receipt from you of all information we may request from you regarding such claim.</p>

    <p>During any investigation of your claim of any unauthorized signature, forgery, alteration, unauthorized paper draft, or unauthorized item with respect to your account, we may elect to freeze or not credit you for the amount of such item(s) until we have completed our investigation.</p>

    <p>We are not responsible for any temporary unavailability of funds in your account during the time in which the disputed item(s) are under investigation. This includes forged checks, unauthorized paper drafts and unauthorized items.</p>

    <p>If our investigation reveals that the disputed signature or item was properly charged to your account, you agree to reimburse us for all of our costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with such investigation and related actions.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.3.6">
    <h4>Account Liability/Customer Assistance</h4>

    <p>If you notify us of any alleged fraudulent or unauthorized item or transaction affecting your account and we elect to credit your account for the amount of any such alleged fraudulent or unauthorized item or transaction, you must fully cooperate with and assist us during any investigation or proceeding involving such unauthorized items as requested by us from time to time. This includes, but is not limited to, filing a police report, assisting us with criminal prosecution, or other actions deemed necessary by the Bank.</p>

    <p>If you refuse or fail to fully cooperate and assist us in any investigation or proceeding involving such unauthorized items by or for your benefit, then, at our election, you must repay to us the amount of any prior account credit for the unauthorized item(s), and we may deduct such amounts from your account without further notice. In addition, you agree to hold the Bank harmless for any loss you incur as a result of the unauthorized item(s).</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.3.7">
    <h4>Escheatment</h4>

    <p>Accounts that are inactive for a period of time may be considered to be dormant and are subject to escheat. Each state has varying laws as to when the account is subject to escheat, and the Bank may be required to send the funds to the state of your last known address. We will make all reasonable efforts to contact you before transferring your <span style="white-space: nowrap;">account(s)</span> to an applicable state. For accounts with international addresses, the funds will be transferred to the State of Delaware.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.3.8">
    <h4>Duty of Care</h4>

    <p>In accordance with reasonable banking standards, most checks and other items presented to us for payment are processed through automated processing and, except in limited circumstances and subject to such reasonable sampling procedures as we establish at our discretion, most items are not individually examined to verify your signature or verify that the item is otherwise properly payable. You agree that we act within reasonable banking standards by processing most checks, paper drafts and other items through automated processing systems.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-2.3.9">
    <h4>Foreign Activity</h4>

    <p>If you have moved outside of the United States or have frequent international transactions, you may be contacted about the international activity in your account and for further verification of your address. If you are moving or will be temporarily residing overseas, we recommend you notify us via telephone or secure messaging to prevent any disruption in your account activity. Your account may also be closed, depending on the location.</p>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="s-3">
<h4>Inactive and Dormant Accounts</h4>

<p>For security reasons, your account will be monitored for inactivity. If there is no transactional activity in or out of your account for a period of 180 days, the account will be considered dormant (or abandoned), and you will be assessed a fee in accordance with the <strong><a href="/policies/schedule-of-fees/">Schedule of Fees</a></strong>. To the extent there is a balance in the account, interest will continue to accrue. However, once there is no remaining balance in the account, the account will be automatically closed. For security reasons, your debit card will be suspended and any further <abbr title="Negotiable Order of Withdrawal">NOW</abbr> account transactions will be rejected. You may reactivate your account at any time by calling +1 888-248-0632 or sending a secure message via the Simple Web site, <a href="https://www.simple.com">https://www.simple.com</a>. Upon verification, your account may be reopened.</p>

<div id="s-3.1">
  <div id="s-3.1.1">
    <h4>Death or Incompetence</h4>

    <p>You or your appointed party, designee, or appointed individual agree to notify us promptly if any person with signatory rights on your account dies or becomes legally incompetent or incapacitated. We may continue to honor such checks and items until (a) we know of the fact of death or of adjudication of incompetence or incapacitation and (b) we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that knowledge. You agree that, even if we have knowledge of an account signer's death, we may pay or certify checks drawn on or before the date of death for up to 10 days after that date, unless ordered to stop payment by someone claiming an interest in the account. We may require additional documentation to confirm any claims made on the account.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-3.1.2">
    <h4>Power of Attorney</h4>

    <p>The Bank will honor a Power of Attorney designation on an account, provided it receives the required documentation evidencing such designation. The account owner and person executing power of attorney over a Deposit Account is known as the "<span class="underline">Principal</span>." The person granted power of attorney for the Principal is known as the "<span class="underline">Attorney-in-Fact</span>." We may refuse to accept a power of attorney for reasonable cause, and we may require the Attorney-in-Fact to sign an affidavit stating that the power of attorney presented to us is a true copy and that, to the best of the Attorney-in-Fact's knowledge, the Principal continues to be alive and competent and the relevant powers of the Attorney-in-Fact have not been amended or terminated.</p>

    <p>The Principal is responsible for providing us with any information if an affidavit presented to us is untrue or misleading or if the Attorney-in-Fact exceeds the authority granted by the Principal in the power of attorney. The Attorney-in-Fact is required to notify us in writing if the Principal or any other account owner dies or is declared incompetent.</p>

    <p>The power of attorney will continue in force until (a) we receive written revocation from the Principal; (b) we receive written notification of the Principal's death; or (c) we receive written notification of the death or incapacity of the Attorney-in-Fact.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-3.1.3">
    <h4>Facsimile Signatures</h4>

    <p>Before using any form of facsimile or mobile signature in connection with a Deposit Account, you agree to submit a sample to us and to execute and deliver agreements in a form we require. When you use a facsimile or mobile signature, you agree that you shall have the sole responsibility for ensuring the security of the facsimile or mobile signature, and you bear the entire risk for unauthorized use thereof, whether or not you are negligent, except where it may be required by law.</p>

    <p>You agree that no facsimile or mobile signature we have been authorized to honor may be considered a forgery or an unauthorized signature, and that such facsimile shall be effective as your signature or endorsement, whether or not you have been negligent. You further agree to indemnify us and hold us harmless from and against any and all losses, costs, damages, liabilities or exposures we or you may suffer or incur as a result of the unlawful use, unauthorized use, or misuse by any person of any such facsimile or automated signature or the device by which it is affixed.</p>

    <h4>Fees and Charges</h4>

    <p>You agree to pay the charges as shown on the <strong><a href="/policies/schedule-of-fees/">Schedule of Fees</a></strong>, which is provided in these disclosures and posted on the Simple Web site. Fees or charges incurred on your account will be deducted directly from the account balance. We will not be held liable for any items that are dishonored or any other debts that may occur from the deduction of charges as stated in this Agreement.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-3.1.5">
    <h4>Interest Rate and Annual Percentage Yield (APY)</h4>

    <p>Your account may earn interest at such a rate and compounding list frequency as disclosed on the Simple Web site. We use the Daily Balance Method for calculating your interest. This method applies a daily periodic rate to the principal in the account each day. Interest begins to accrue on the business day you deposit noncash items (for example, checks). The rate is subject to change and may be found on the Simple Web site or your periodic statement. You may view the current rate at <a href="https://www.simple.com/policies/rates">https://www.simple.com/policies/rates</a>.</p>

    <h4>IRS Backup Withholding</h4>

    <p>If you do not provide us with your correct Tax Identification Number (Social Security Number or Employer Identification Number) and the required certification, or if we receive a notice from the Internal Revenue Service ("<span class="underline">IRS</span>"), the interest earned on your account may be subject to federal backup withholding at the IRS-mandated rate.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-3.1.7">
    <h4>Court Attachments; IRS Levies; Adverse Claims; Similar Actions</h4>

    <p>If your account becomes subject to legal action, such as a tax levy or third-party garnishment, we reserve the right to refuse to pay any money from your account, including items presented for payment, until the action is resolved. If we are required to pay an attachment, garnishment or tax levy, we are not liable to you. Payment is made after satisfying any fees, charges or other debts owed to us. You agree that you are responsible for any expenses, including legal expenses and fees we incur due to a garnishment, levy or attachment on your account. We may charge these expenses to your account. Until we receive the appropriate court documents, we may continue to process transactions against your account, even if we have received an unofficial notification of an adverse claim. You will indemnify us for any losses if we do this.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-3.1.8">
    <h4>Additional Information</h4>

    <p>You will provide us with any other documentation or information that we request in connection with your Account. Your failure to provide this information may result in federal backup withholding and restrict your ability to use the account transactions in which these documents are required for verification purposes. We may incorporate the Signature Card in the application for the account, and your signature may be captured electronically.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-3.1.9">
    <h4>Financial Information</h4>

    <p>You agree to provide us with accurate and complete financial and other information we request in connection with a Deposit Account. Information concerning a Deposit Account may be reported to credit reporting agencies and will be made available when requested by proper legal procedures.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-3.1.10">
    <h4>Personal Accounts</h4>

    <p>An account opened for personal use cannot be used for business purposes. If your personal account is identified as being used as a business account, it will be closed.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-3.1.11">
    <h4>Account Closings</h4>

    <p>If you wish to close your Deposit Account with the Bank, you agree to notify us of this intention in writing. After a Deposit Account is closed, we have no obligation to accept deposits or pay outstanding items, but may do so at our discretion and any access device will no longer be active. You agree to hold us harmless for honoring or refusing to honor any check, paper draft, or other item on a closed account. A Bank check for the balance in the account will be sent to the address on file within 14 business days of your final transaction and/or of receiving all required documentation for closing the account. All related closing fees as noted in our <strong><a href="/policies/schedule-of-fees/">Schedule of Fees</a></strong> may be deducted from the final balance. If your balance is $2.00 or less, the Bank will not send a check for the balance. The Bank reserves the right to close your account at any time.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="s-3.1.12">
    <h4>Internal Accounting of Balances</h4>

    <p>The following is a summary of the functionality of your account. This is an explanation of how your account is structured and does not reflect any changes to your account functionality at this time. Your checking account will consist of two (2) "Sub-Accounts" on the books of the Bank: (1) either a demand deposit (non-interest-bearing) account or a <abbr title="Negotiable Order of Withdrawal">NOW</abbr> (interest-bearing) account; and (2) a savings deposit, as those terms are defined under federal law. The two will be treated as a single account for Customer use, and you will see no effect.</p>

    <p>All deposits and other credits will be posted to, and debits will be deducted from, the demand deposit or <abbr title="Negotiable Order of Withdrawal">NOW</abbr> account. Whenever the demand deposit or NOW account balance exceeds a "threshold amount" (which we may establish and change at our discretion), we may transfer funds above that amount to the savings deposit. As these funds are needed to pay items presented against your checking account, the appropriate amount will be transferred back to the demand deposit or <abbr title="Negotiable Order of Withdrawal">NOW</abbr> account, up to six (6) times per statement cycle. If a sixth transfer is needed, the entire balance of the savings deposit will be transferred into the demand deposit or <abbr title="Negotiable Order of Withdrawal">NOW</abbr> account. This process may be repeated each month.</p>

    <p>For interest-bearing checking accounts, we will pay the same rate of interest on balances in both sub- accounts. Your periodic statement will show a single annual percentage yield earned on the combined balances.</p>

  <h3>Unauthorized Transfers</h3>

  <p>Advise us immediately if you believe your Card and/or <abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr> has been lost or stolen. Telephoning us is the best way of keeping your possible losses down. If we are advised within two (2) business days, your loss is limited to $50, if someone used your Card and/or <abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr> without your permission. If we are not advised within two (2) business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Card or <abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr>, you could lose as much as $500.</p>

  <h3>Card Transactions</h3>

  <p>Consistent with applicable law, you may use your Card with your <abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr> to perform most routine transactions on the accounts that are accessible by your Card.</p>

  <p>You can use your Card to:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Make cash withdrawals</li>
    <li>Make deposits of cash, checks, or drafts</li>
    <li>Obtain your most recently available account balance</li>
    <li>Pay for purchases at places that have agreed to accept the Card</li>

  <p>Some of the above services may not be available at all ATMs or locations.</p>

</div>

<div id="s-5.4">
  <h3>International <abbr title="Automated Teller Machine">ATM</abbr> Transactions</h3>
  <p>
  International transactions requested through your Card are converted to U.S. currency according to the rules and regulations of the <abbr title="Automated Teller Machine">ATM</abbr> network. The conversion of the currency to U.S. currency may occur on a date other than your original transaction date, and fees may be assessed by these networks. You are responsible for the U.S. currency amount plus any fees assessed for the currency conversion. Some services may not be available at international <abbr title="Automated Teller Machine">ATM</abbr> terminals. International <abbr title="Automated Teller Machine">ATM</abbr> transactions may be subject to a fee in accordance with our <strong><a href="/policies/schedule-of-fees/">Schedule of Fees</a></strong>.</p>
</div>

<div id="s-5.5">
  <h3>Charges Made In Foreign Currencies</h3>

  <p>If you engage in a transaction in a currency other than U.S. dollars using your Card, Visa will convert the charge into a U.S. dollar amount. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is either (a) a rate selected by Visa from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives, or (b) the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The currency conversion rate for the processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the date of the transaction or the date the transaction is posted to your billing statement.</p>

  <p>For each purchase transaction in a foreign currency that has been converted into a U.S. dollar amount by Visa, the Bank may assess a foreign currency conversion fee in accordance with our <strong><a href="/policies/schedule-of-fees/">Schedule of Fees</a></strong> and will retain that amount for its services. The standard limits for ATM and POS transactions are different for foreign transactions. Refer to the limits section. </p>
</div>

<div id="s-5.6">
  <h3>Limitations on Frequency of <abbr title="Automated Teller Machine">ATM</abbr> Transactions and Cash Withdrawal Limits</h3>

  <p>With your <abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr>, you may use your Card to obtain cash from any <abbr title="Automated Teller Machine">ATM</abbr> or any <abbr title="Point of Sale">POS</abbr> device, as permissible by the merchant, which bears the STAR®, PLUS® or Allpoint® acceptance marks. All <abbr title="Automated Teller Machine">ATM</abbr> transactions are treated as cash withdrawal transactions.</p>

  <p>The maximum cumulative amount that you may withdraw from an <abbr title="Automated Teller Machine">ATM</abbr> per twenty-four (24) hour period is $500. The maximum cumulative amount that you may withdraw from an <abbr title="Automated Teller Machine">ATM</abbr> per 30-day period is $5,000.</p>
  
  <p>If you are traveling overseas your ATM limit is $500 per day. For security reasons these amounts may be reduced depending on prior activity.</p>

  <p>The maximum amount that you may withdraw through a participating bank (over-the-counter withdrawal) per 24-hour period is $5,000.</p>
  
  <p>There are certain types of cash transactions that you may withdraw $1,000 per day. This includes, but is not limited to, purchasing money orders, traveler's checks, and foreign currency.</p>

  <p>Any funds withdrawn from a <abbr title="Point of Sale">POS</abbr> device or through a participating bank (over-the-counter withdrawal) will be subject to the maximum amount of $20,000 that may be spent on your Card per 30-day period.</p>

  <p>Frequency-of-use limitations are imposed on <abbr title="Automated Teller Machine">ATM</abbr> transactions for security reasons and for the protection of your account. They are not disclosed for this reason and may be changed at any time. You will be denied the use of your Card if:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>You exceed the daily <abbr title="Automated Teller Machine">ATM</abbr> withdrawal or purchase limit;</li>
    <li>You do not have sufficient available funds in your account;</li>
    <li>You do not enter your correct <abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr>; or</li>
    <li>You exceed the limit on the number of times you can use your Card each day.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The receipt provided by the <abbr title="Automated Teller Machine">ATM</abbr> or merchant terminal will notify you of the denial. There is a limit on the number of such denials permitted, beyond which the machine may retain your Card. The number of attempts that will cause the retention of your Card is also not disclosed for security reasons.</p>
</div>

<div id="s-5.7">
  <h3>Card Transactions and Daily Limits <a name="daily-limit"></a></h3>

  <p>Consistent with applicable law, you may use your Card to purchase goods and services and/or obtain cash where permitted by the merchant, from any merchant who accepts Visa® Cards. The merchant will require your signature instead of your <abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr> to authorize the purchase request. You may also use your Card with your <abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr> at any merchant location where <abbr title="Automated Teller Machine">ATM</abbr> cards are accepted to purchase goods and services and/or obtain cash where permitted by the merchant. The amount of all purchases, including any cash obtained, will be deducted from your <abbr title="Negotiable Order of Withdrawal">NOW</abbr> account.</p>

  <p>If you use your Card number without presenting your Card (such as for a mail order, telephone, or Internet purchase), the legal effect will be the same as if you used the Card itself. For security reasons, we may limit the amount or number of transactions you can make on your Card. You may not use your Card for online gambling or any illegal transaction.</p>

  <p>When you make a purchase through the debit card network, we may place a hold on the funds in your <abbr title="Negotiable Order of Withdrawal">NOW</abbr> account that may be necessary to cover the amount of the transaction. (Please see "Preauthorization Holds," below, for additional information.)</p>

  <p>Each time you use your Card, you authorize us to reduce the value available in your <abbr title="Negotiable Order of Withdrawal">NOW</abbr> account by the amount of the transaction and any applicable fees. You may not exceed the available amount in your <abbr title="Negotiable Order of Withdrawal">NOW</abbr> account through an individual transaction or a series of transactions.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, if a transaction exceeds the balance of the funds available on your Card, you shall remain fully liable to us for the amount of the transaction and any applicable fees listed in the <strong><a href="/policies/schedule-of-fees/">Schedule of Fees</a></strong>.</p>

  <p>The maximum amount that you may use for the purchase of goods and services on your Card per 24- hour period is $6,000. If you are traveling overseas your limit is $1,000 per day. For security reasons these amounts may be reduced depending on prior activity.</p>
</div>

<div id="s-5.8">
  <h3>Rules of Card Associations</h3>

  <p>If you report the loss or theft of your Card within two (2) business days of when you discover the loss or theft of the Card, and you have not been grossly negligent or have not engaged in fraud, you will not be liable for any unauthorized transactions using your lost or stolen Card, when used for signature-based point-of-sale transactions. If you do not advise us within two (2) business days, your liability is the lesser of $50 or the amount of money, property, labor or services obtained by the unauthorized use before notification to us.</p>

  <div id="s-5.8.1">
    <h4>Processing Procedures</h4>

    <p>New procedures are in effect that may impact you when you use your Card at certain merchants.</p>

    <p>In the past, transactions were processed as Visa debit transactions unless you entered a <abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr>. Now, if you do not enter a <abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr>, transactions may be processed as either a Visa debit transaction or a transaction processed by another network listed on the back of your Card.</p>

    <p>Merchants are responsible for providing you with a clear way of choosing to make a Visa debit transaction, if they support the option.</p>

    <p>If a network other than Visa is used when making a transaction without a <abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr>, different terms may apply. Certain protections and rights described in this Agreement are applicable only to Visa debit transactions and do not apply to transactions processed by another network.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="s-5.9">
  <h3>Preauthorization Holds</h3>

  <p>When your Card or other network enhancement feature related to the Card is used at a point-of-sale location to obtain goods or services or obtain cash, the merchant may attempt to obtain preauthorization from us for the transaction. We place a 7-business-day hold on your account for the amount of the preauthorization request, which may vary in some cases from the amount of the actual purchase, depending on the merchant's request. If the preauthorization request varies from the amount of the actual transaction, payment of the transaction may not remove the hold, which will remain on the account until the end of the tenth business day. This hold may affect the availability of funds from your <abbr title="Negotiable Order of Withdrawal">NOW</abbr> account to pay for Electronic Fund Transfers. We will not be responsible for damages for wrongful dishonor of any items that are not paid because of the hold.</p>

  <p>If you use your Card at an automated fuel dispenser ("pay at the pump"), the merchant may preauthorize the transaction amount up to $100. If your Card is declined even though you have sufficient funds available, pay for your purchase directly with the cashier.</p>

  <p>If you use your Card at a restaurant, at a hotel, for a car rental, or for similar purchases, the merchant may preauthorize the transaction amount for the purchase amount plus up to 20 percent to ensure there are sufficient funds available to cover tips or incidental expenses incurred. Any preauthorization amount will place a "hold" on your available funds until the merchant sends us the final payment amount of your purchase. Once the final payment amount is received, the preauthorization amount on hold will be removed. It may take up to thirty (30) days for the hold to be removed. During the hold period, you will not have access to the preauthorized amount.</p>
</div>

<div id="s-5.10">
  <h3>Preauthorized Debits or Credits</h3>

  <p>You may arrange to have certain recurring payments automatically deposited (credited) to your account. Examples of this service include the direct deposit of Social Security and other government payments, and the direct deposit of your payroll.</p>

  <p>You may arrange to have certain recurring withdrawals automatically paid (debited) from your account. For example, you may arrange to have insurance premiums paid automatically.</p>

  <p>These preauthorized transfers are governed by federal regulations pertaining to Electronic Fund Transfer services that entitle you to certain protections. Requests for these services must be authorized by you in writing prior to becoming effective.</p>
</div>

<div id="s-5.11">
  <h3>Right to Stop Payments and Preauthorized Electronic Payments and How to Do So</h3>

  <p>If you want to permanently revoke a recurring preauthorized electronic transfer you authorized from a third party, you will need to first send written instructions to the originating third party to cancel your preauthorized transfer.</p>

  <p>If you have authorized regular payments out of your account, you can stop any of these payments by notifying the Customer Relations team by telephone, email or secure messaging, you may be required to confirm the information provided by writing to us at the following address:</p>

    <a href="https://www.simple.com">https://www.simple.com</a>
  </address>

  <p>Your request must include your account number, the name of the payee, the amount of the item to be stopped, and the date payment was scheduled to be made. You must indicate if your intention is to stop only one instance or all instances of this recurring payment. This request needs to be received by us three (3) or more business days before the payment is scheduled to be made. If your request is by telephone or through the Simple Web site, we may also require you to put your request in writing and ensure that it is received by us within 14 days after your call or electronic message. A stop-payment fee may be charged for each stop-payment and renewal order you request in accordance with our <strong><a href="/policies/schedule-of-fees/">Schedule of Fees</a></strong>.</p>

  <div id="s-5.11.1">
    <h4>Stop-Payment Liability</h4>

    <p>If you order us to stop payment on any preauthorized transfer according to the requirements above and we fail to do so, we will be liable for your proven loss or damages, unless:</p>

      <li>You failed to give us enough information, proper instructions or sufficient time to act on the stop-payment; or</li>

      <li>We do not receive written confirmation of your telephone or electronic message request to stop payment within 14 calendar days, and the preauthorized transfer occurs after the 14 calendar days.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In any case, we will only be liable for actual proven damages if the failure to make your transaction resulted from a bona fide error on our part, despite our procedures to avoid such errors. If we pay a preauthorized transfer over your valid and timely stop order, we may re-credit your account. If we do this, you will sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee. You agree to transfer to us all of your rights against the payee. In addition, you will assist us in any legal action taken against the payee.</p>

    <p>In addition, if you want to permanently revoke a recurring preauthorized electronic transfer, you will need to first send written instructions to the originating third party to cancel your preauthorized transfer. We may ask you to provide us with a copy of your letter to the originating third party and sign an Affidavit of "Authorization Revoked/Stop All Payments" request with us.</p>

  <p>One-time immediate transfers can be made from a linked Simple checking to an active linked Simple checking account(s).</p>
  <p>Scheduled and recurring transfers can be made from a linked Simple checking to an active linked Simple checking account(s).</p>

You may send a Simple-to-Simple Transfer using Internet Banking or by entering the email address and mobile phone number of the recipient.

The name you enter will help you identify your intended recipient for reference in the drop down menu and your transaction history but will not be used to process payments.

<h2>Arbitration Provision</h2>

<div id="s-8.1">
  <h3>Purpose</h3>

  <p>This Arbitration Provision sets forth the circumstances and procedures under which claims (as defined below) may be arbitrated instead of litigated in court.</p>
</div>

<div id="s-8.2">
  <h3>Definitions</h3>

  <p>As used in this Arbitration Provision, the term "<span class="underline">Claim</span>" means any claim, dispute or controversy between you and us arising from or relating to the Deposit Account or this Agreement as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us or the relationships resulting from this Agreement, including the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Provision or the Agreements. "Claim" includes claims of every kind and nature, including, but not limited to, initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third-party claims and claims based upon contract, tort, fraud and other intentional torts, statutes, regulations, common law and equity. The term "Claim" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced and includes, by way of example and without limitation, any claim, dispute or controversy that arises from or relates to (i) your Deposit Account, or the Cards of any additional authorized users designated by you; (ii) the amount of available funds in the accounts; (iii) advertisements, promotions or oral or written statements related to the account, goods or services purchased with the Cards or by other electronic means; and (iv) the benefits and services related to the account. We shall not elect to use arbitration under the Arbitration Provision for any Claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court of your state or municipality, so long as the Claim is individual and pending only in the court.</p>

  <p>As solely used in this Arbitration Provision, the terms "<span class="underline">we</span>" and "<span class="underline">us</span>" shall for all purposes mean The Bancorp Bank, wholly or majority owned subsidiaries, affiliates, licensees, predecessors, successors, and assigns; and all of their agents, employees, directors and representatives. In addition, "we" or "us" shall include any third party using or providing any product, service or benefit in connection with any account if, and only if, such third party is named as a co-party with us (or files a Claim with or against us) in connection with a Claim asserted by you.</p>

  <p>As solely used in this Arbitration Provision, the terms "<span class="underline">you</span>" or "<span class="underline">yours</span>" shall mean all persons or entities approved by us to have and/or use the account, including, but not limited, to all persons or entities contractually obligated under any of the Agreements and all additional authorized users.</p>
</div>

<div id="s-8.3">
  <h3>Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Administrator</h3>

  <p>Any Claim shall be resolved, upon the election by you or us, by arbitration pursuant to this Arbitration Provision and the code of procedures of the national arbitration organization to which the Claim is referred in effect at the time the Claim is filed. Claims shall be referred to either Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("<span class="underline"><abbr title="Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services">JAMS</abbr></span>") or the American Arbitration Association ("<span class="underline"><abbr title="American Arbitration Association">AAA</abbr></span>"), as selected by the party electing to use arbitration. If a selection by us of one of these organizations is unacceptable to you, you shall have the right within 30 days after you receive notice of our election to select the other organization listed to serve as arbitrator administrator.</p>

  <p>For a copy of the procedures, to file a Claim, or for other information about these organizations, contact them as follows: (i) <abbr title="Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services">JAMS</abbr> at 1920 Main Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 92614 (www.jamsadr.com); or (ii) <abbr title="American Arbitration Association">AAA</abbr> at 335 Madison Avenue, New York, <abbr title="New York">NY</abbr> 10017 (www.adr.org).</p>
</div>

<div id="s-8.4">
  <h3>Significance of Arbitration</h3>

  <p><strong>IF ARBITRATION IS CHOSEN BY ANY PARTY WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM, NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE THAT CLAIM IN COURT <abbr title="Oregon">OR</abbr> HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON THAT CLAIM, <abbr title="Oregon">OR</abbr> TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR IN THE CODE OF PROCEDURES OF <abbr title="Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services">JAMS</abbr> <abbr title="Oregon">OR</abbr> THE <abbr title="American Arbitration Association">AAA</abbr>, AS APPLICABLE (THE "<span class="underline">CODE</span>"). FURTHER, YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY <abbr title="Oregon">OR</abbr> AS A MEMBER OF ANY CLASS OF CLAIMANTS PERTAINING TO ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH BELOW, THE ARBITRATOR'S DECISION WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING. NOTE THAT OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.</strong></p>
</div>

<div id="s-8.5">
  <h3>Restrictions on Arbitration</h3>

  <p>If either party elects to resolve a Claim by arbitration, that Claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis. There shall be no right or authority for any Claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving Claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other account holders or other persons similarly situated. The arbitrator's authority to resolve Claims is limited to Claims between you and us alone, and the arbitrator's authority to make awards is limited to you and us alone. Furthermore, Claims brought by you against us or by us against you may not be joined or consolidated in arbitration with Claims brought by or against someone other than you, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by all parties.</p>
</div>

<div id="s-8.6">
  <h3>Location of Arbitration and Payment of Fees</h3>

  <p>Any arbitration hearing that you attend shall take place in the federal judicial district of your residence. At your written request, we will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of all or part of the filing, administrative and/or hearing fees for any Claim you initiate as to which you or we seek arbitration. At the conclusion of the arbitration (or any appeal thereof), the arbitrator (or panel) will decide who will ultimately be responsible for paying the filing, administrative and/or hearing fees in connection with the arbitration (or appeal). If and to the extent you incur filing, administrative and/or hearing fees in arbitration, including for any appeal, exceeding the amount they would have been if the Claim had been brought in the state or federal court that is closest to the mailing address we have in our records and would have had jurisdiction over the Claim, we will reimburse you to that extent unless the arbitrator (or panel) determines that the fees were incurred without any substantial justification.</p>
</div>

<div id="s-8.7">
  <h3>Arbitration Procedures</h3>

  <p>This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr>C. Sections 1-16, as it may be amended (the "<span class="underline"><abbr title="Federal Arbitration Act">FAA</abbr></span>"). The arbitration shall be governed by the applicable Code, except that (to the extent enforceable under the <abbr title="Federal Arbitration Act">FAA</abbr>) this Arbitration Provision shall control if it is inconsistent with the applicable Code. In conducting the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall not apply the federal or any state rules of civil procedure or rules of evidence.</p>

  <p>Either party may submit a request to the arbitrator to expand the scope of discovery allowable under the applicable Code. The party submitting such a request must provide a copy to the other party, who may submit objections to the arbitrator with a copy of the objections provided to the requesting party, within 15 days of receiving the requesting party's notice. The granting or denial of such request will be in the sole discretion of the arbitrator who shall notify the parties of his/her decision within 20 days of the objecting party's submission.</p>

  <p>The arbitrator shall take reasonable steps to preserve the privacy of individuals and business matters.</p>

  <p>Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the <abbr title="Federal Arbitration Act">FAA</abbr>. However, any party can appeal that award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the same arbitration organization, which shall consider anew any aspect of the initial award objected to by the appealing party. The appealing party shall have 30 days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award to notify the arbitration organization that it is exercising the right of appeal. The appeal shall be filed with the arbitration organization in the form of a dated writing. The arbitration organization will then notify the other party that the award has been appealed. The arbitration organization will appoint a three-arbitrator panel that will conduct arbitration pursuant to its Code and issue its decision within 120 days of the date of the appellant's written notice. The decision of the panel shall be by majority vote and shall be final and binding.</p>
</div>

<div id="s-8.8">
  <h3>Continuation</h3>

  <p>This Arbitration Provision shall survive termination of your account as well as voluntary payment of any debt in full by you and any legal proceeding by us to collect a debt owed by you. If any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable under any principle or provision of law or equity, consistent with the <abbr title="Federal Arbitration Act">FAA</abbr>, it shall not invalidate the remaining portions of this Arbitration Provision, the Agreement or any prior agreements you may have had with us, each of which shall be enforceable regardless of such invalidity.</p>
