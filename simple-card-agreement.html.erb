title: BBVA Compass Simple Visa Card Agreement
---

<p><strong>Hello again! We have another important collection of legal, bank­y words for you to check out and (hopefully) agree to. This Card Agreement covers all the basics of using and living with your new wallet­-sized friend, the Simple Visa® Card.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you’ve used a debit card before, this information will probably be familiar. But if you’re in the market for a refresher course on what happens when you swipe, or how to protect your PIN, look no further. And If you need this information in the future, you’ll find it here.</strong></p>

<p>This Simple Visa Card Agreement and Disclosure Statement (“Agreement”) applies to the Simple Visa© Debit Card (“Card”) previously issued, or to be issued, by Compass Bank on behalf of Simple Finance Technology Corp. Compass Bank is pleased to issue you a Card, which enables you to make certain electronic fund transfers to and from your Deposit Account. You do not have to sign this Agreement but you should sign the Card as soon as you receive it – it helps protect against unauthorized use of your Card. By retaining or using the Card or by authorizing anyone else to use the Card, you have agreed to the terms of this Agreement. Please read this Agreement carefully and keep it for future reference.</p>

<h3>2. USE OF YOUR CARD:</h3>

<p>Each transaction on your Card is considered an “item” under the Deposit Account agreement applicable to that transaction, and will be subject to the terms of that agreement. To protect the use of your Card, you will be provided with a PIN, which must be used on all ATM Transactions and PIN Transactions. You should not disclose your PIN to anyone. If the security or confidentiality of your PIN is compromised, you should notify us at once by calling 1-­888-­248-­0632 or sending a support message via the Web or Mobile Applications. Your Card will allow you to conduct:</p>

<ul>
<li>ATM Transactions: Your Card may be used with a PIN at any ATM connected to the Networks, to make cash withdrawals directly from your Primary Checking Account;</li>
<li>PIN Transactions: Your Card may be used with a PIN to access funds in your Primary Checking Account to purchase goods or services and to obtain cash at any merchant that participates in the Networks.</li>
<li>Visa Transactions: Your Card also may be used without a PIN to access funds in your Primary Checking Account to purchase goods or services at any merchant that accepts Visa debit cards, and to make cash withdrawals from the tellers at those banks and other financial institutions that participate in the Visa Network and accept Visa debit cards.</li>
</ul>


<p>PIN Transactions and Visa Transactions are accepted solely at the option of individual business establishments, banks and other financial institutions, and you agree that we will not be liable to you for refusal by any such business, bank or financial institution to honor the Card.</p>

<p><strong>PREAUTHORIZED RECURRING TRANSFERS; STOPPING PAYMENT ON TRANSACTIONS:</strong> If you use your Card or the account number for your Card to authorize in advance any recurring payments from your Deposit Account (for example, a monthly gym membership fee) and later wish to stop one or more of these payments, you should contact the merchant/biller directly. If the merchant/biller fails to stop the recurring payments, contact us at at 1­888­248­0632 or send a support message via the Web or Mobile Applications. If you wish us to stop a particular payment, you must notify us as provided in the agreement for the Deposit Account from which this payment is made in time for us to receive your request three (3) business days or more before the payment is scheduled to be made. If you deliver your stop payment request by telephone you must confirm your stop payment order in writing within 21 days of your oral stop payment order. An oral stop payment request will not be binding on us after 21 days if you fail to provide the required written confirmation (which can be in the form of a support message in the Web or Mobile Applications). Your Card may have to be cancelled in order to stop recurring payments.</p>

<h3>3. HOLDS FOR AUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>We may place a hold on your Deposit Account for a Card transaction:</strong> When you use your Card for certain transactions (including every PIN and many Visa Transactions), the merchant accepting your Card may request advance authorization of that transaction. If we authorize a transaction, we may place a temporary “hold” on your Deposit Account for the amount of the authorized transaction, which we refer to as a “POS hold.” A POS hold is not payment for an authorized transaction. We will make payment for a transaction only after the actual transaction is presented to us physically or electronically.</li>
<li><strong>Release of POS holds:</strong> Any POS hold on your Deposit Account will be released upon the earlier of: (a) the day we: (i) receive the actual transaction, (ii) post that transaction to your Account for payment, and (iii) match the authorization of that transaction to the actual transaction; or (b) three (3) business days after the date we authorized that transaction. The release of the POS hold will be in the form of a credit to your Deposit Account for the amount of the hold. Credits for released POS holds and payments for Card transactions are posted separately to your Account, and the credit for any particular POS hold is not used to pay the particular transaction for which the hold was placed.</li>
<li><strong>Effect of an authorization hold:</strong> Each POS hold will reduce the available balance in your Deposit Account by the amount of the hold. In the event the available balance in your Deposit Account is insufficient to pay items posted to your Account, transactions will decline.</li>
<li><strong>Authorization requests by merchants:</strong> Under the Visa rules governing Card transactions, merchants generally are permitted to request authorization only for the actual amount of a transaction. However, certain kinds of merchants in specified situations are permitted to request authorization for a Card transaction in an amount different from the amount of the actual transaction. For example, restaurants and drinking establishments may request authorization for the estimated amount of a transaction, and others may request authorization for an amount up to 20% over the amount of the actual bill in order to cover an anticipated tip. When we receive an authorization request from a merchant, we do not receive information from which to determine whether the request covers the actual amount of a transaction, an estimated amount, or whether the merchant’s request exceeds the amount permitted by the Visa rules.
For example:</li>
<li>If you use your Card to pay for a $50 dinner, the restaurant may request
authorization for a $60 transaction, as permitted by the Visa rules.</li>
<li>If you use your Card at a drinking establishment to order drinks totaling $10,
the establishment might request authorization for a $50 transaction in anticipation that you will place additional orders. Even though this practice may not be permitted by the Visa rules, we cannot make this determination at the time we receive the authorization request.</li>
<li>Card terminals used for “pay at the pump” gasoline purchases will check for authorization before the amount of any purchase is determined. Authorization will be given only if the available balance in your Deposit Account equals or exceeds a certain designated amount, which may vary among merchants and change from time to time. Because authorization is based on this designated amount (not the amount of your intended purchase), authorization may be declined even though the available balance in your Deposit Account is sufficient to cover your intended purchase. To avoid authorizations that may exceed the amount of your intended purchase, you may pay inside the station rather than at the pump. If we authorize a Card transaction, the POS hold will be for the amount requested by the merchant, which may be in excess of the amount of the actual transaction or the amount permitted by the Visa rules. Because each POS hold reduces the available balance in your Deposit Account, any authorization request by a merchant for an amount that exceeds the amount of the actual transaction may cause you to have insufficient funds to pay items posted to your Deposit Account.</li>
</ul>


<h3>4. ILLEGAL TRANSACTIONS:</h3>

<p>You agree that you will not use your Card for any transaction that is illegal in the jurisdiction where you live, in the jurisdiction where the transaction is consummated, or in any other jurisdiction affected by the transaction. You agree that it is your responsibility to determine the legality of each transaction in all applicable jurisdictions before entering into such transaction. Display of the Visa logo or any other logo by any person accepting the Card does not indicate that the transaction is legal in all applicable jurisdictions. You acknowledge and agree that we have no obligation to monitor, to review or to evaluate the legality of your Card transactions. You also agree that you will not use your Card in connection with any Internet or on­line gambling transaction or lottery ticket purchase, whether or not the same is legal in any applicable jurisdiction. We reserve the right to decline any transaction that we, in our sole discretion, believe is an illegal transaction, an Internet or on­line gambling transaction, lottery ticket purchase or a high­risk transaction. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to pay for any Card transaction that you authorized, even if that transaction is determined to be illegal.</p>

<h3>5. LIMITATIONS ON FREQUENCY AND DOLLAR AMOUNT OF TRANSACTIONS:</h3>

<ul>
<li>For security reasons, there are restrictions imposed on your Card that may
limit your ability to use your Card. Some of these restrictions, which are designed to detect and prevent unauthorized use of your Card, cannot be disclosed. Unless you request and the Bank agrees or we notify you otherwise, we may place the following daily limitations on the withdrawals and other transactions you may perform:

<ul>
<li>Total cash withdrawals at ATMs ­ $500 per day or available balance, whichever is less.</li>
<li>Total POS Transactions ­ $6,000 per day or available balance, whichever is less.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>The daily period to which these limitations apply shall commence at 12:00 Midnight on each day and end at 12:00 Midnight on the following day (CST). We may add to, remove from or otherwise change our limitations at any time and without notice to you. Because of the limitations imposed by some non­Compass ATMs and in the event of equipment failure or unavailability, you may not be able to withdraw or to access funds even though you have not exceeded these limitations.</p>

<h3>6. FEES FOR USE OF THE CARD:</h3>

<p>Other than the International Service Fee described in the next paragraph, we do not charge any fees for the use or initial issuance of the Card. We will not charge you a fee to use your Card at any ATM, however, operators of other ATMs and cash ­dispensing devices, their Networks, and merchants may charge you a fee. Some cash ­dispensing devices appear to be ATMs, but actually may process certain transactions as PIN Transactions. If you use your Card multiple times at one of these cash­dispensing devices, some transactions may be processed as PIN Transactions and others as ATM Transactions.</p>

<ul>
<li>“International Transactions” include any transaction that you make using your Card in a foreign currency and any transaction made using your Card outside of the United States of America, even if that transaction is made in U.S. dollars. If you make a transaction in a currency other than U.S. dollars, Visa will convert the amount of that transaction into U.S. dollars according to its own currency conversion procedures in effect at that time. The exchange rate used to convert the currency is either a rate selected by Visa from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets on the applicable processing date (which rate may differ from the rate the entity itself receives), or the government­ mandated exchange rate in effect on the applicable processing date. The exchange rate in effect on the applicable processing date may differ from the exchange rate in effect on the date you used your Card or Account. The amount (in U.S. dollars) of any credit associated with a particular foreign currency transaction is likely to differ from the amount (in U.S. dollars) of the original transaction due to differences in the applicable rates, which may vary daily. VISA may charge you an International Service Fee (sometimes referred to as an “ISF”) equal to one percent (1%) of the U.S. dollar amount of any International Transaction. The International Service Fee will be calculated on the U.S. dollar amount provided to us by Visa and will be charged to the same Account to which the transaction is posted at the same time the International Transaction posts to that Account. The same conversion process and fee may apply if any International Transaction is reversed or credited back to your Account.</li>
</ul>


<h3>7. OUR BUSINESS DAYS:</h3>

<p>Our business days are Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.</p>

<h3>8. DOCUMENTATION OF TRANSACTIONS:</h3>

<p>Each time you use your Card, you will receive or be given the option to obtain a receipt for that transaction. You also will receive or we will make available to you a periodic account statement, which will show you the details of all transactions and transfers made with your Card during the covered period.</p>

<h3>9. YOUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRANSACTIONS USING THE CARD:</h3>

<p>Subject to the limitations described in Section 12 below, you agree that you are responsible for all transactions using the Card.</p>

<h3>10.YOUR CARD OR PIN IS LOST, STOLEN OR SUBJECT TO ANY UNAUTHORIZED USE:</h3>

<p>You agree to notify us immediately if your Card or PIN is lost or stolen, or if you believe either your Card, PIN, or the account number for your Card is subject to any unauthorized use. You also agree to take any reasonable actions we may request to prevent unauthorized Card use. You should provide this notice by calling at 1­-888-­248-­ 0632 OR sending a support message via the Web or Mobile Applications. Telephoning is the best way to keep your possible losses down.</p>

<h3>11.YOUR LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS USING THE CARD, PIN, OR CARD ACCOUNT NUMBER:</h3>

<p>Contact us AT ONCE if you believe that your Card has been lost, stolen or subject to unauthorized use, as provided in Section 13 above. Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible losses down. You could lose all the money in your Deposit Account.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>For Unauthorized ATM and PIN Transactions:</strong> If you believe your Card has been lost, stolen or subject to unauthorized use, and you tell us within two (2) business days after learning of the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your Card and PIN without your permission. For these transactions, if you DO NOT tell us within two (2) business days after learning of the loss, theft or unauthorized use, and we can prove we could have stopped someone from using your Card if you had told us in time, you could lose as much as $500. If you are a California resident, you will not be liable for the $500 amount described in the prior sentence; however, if you fail to report an unauthorized use that appears on a periodic statement within 60 days of our transmittal or making available your periodic statement to you, then you may be liable for the amount of each unauthorized transfer that occurs after the close of the 60 days and before you provide notice to us, unless the delay in notifying us was due to extenuating circumstances beyond your reasonable control.</li>
<li><strong>For Unauthorized Visa Transactions:</strong> If the unauthorized transaction was a Visa Transaction, we agree to extend the benefits provided by the Visa Zero Liability program in effect at the time of the unauthorized use, as long as you notify us within a reasonable period of time after the loss or theft of your Card or any unauthorized use of it. We will determine, in our sole discretion, the reasonableness of any particular period of time based on the circumstances. If your own fraudulent action or gross negligence contributes to the unauthorized use of your Card for a Visa Transaction, then your liability for that use will be determined as provided above in “For Unauthorized ATM and PIN Transactions.” Gross negligence includes but is not limited to your failure to fulfill your obligations under this Agreement, such as your obligations to review your statements and to report any lost or stolen Card or unauthorized use. Also, if your periodic statement shows transfers that you did not make and you DO NOT tell us within sixty (60) days after the statement was mailed or made available to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the sixty (60) day period if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from using your Card or PIN if you had told us in time. If an extenuating circumstance (such as extended travel or hospitalization) prevents you from promptly notifying us of suspected loss, theft or unauthorized use of your Card, the time periods specified in this paragraph may be extended for a reasonable period.</li>
</ul>


<h3>12. OUR LIABILITY FOR FAILURE TO MAKE TRANSFERS:</h3>

<p>If we do not complete a transfer to or from your Deposit Account on time or in the correct amount according to our agreement with you, we will be liable for all your damages proximately caused by such failure. However, there are some exceptions where we will not be liable, including but not limited to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>If, through no fault of our own, you do not have enough funds in your Deposit Account to make the transfer;</li>
<li>If your Deposit Account is subject to legal process or other encumbrance restricting transfers to or from your Account;</li>
<li>If there is a dispute as to the rights of parties to the account(s) or their creditors or representatives and we place a hold on the account until resolution of the dispute;</li>
<li>If the ATM terminal has insufficient cash to complete the transaction;</li>
<li>If the terminal, system or other equipment was not working properly and
you knew about the malfunction when you started the transfer;</li>
<li>If your computer or equipment is corrupted, has a virus, or otherwise not
working properly; or</li>
<li>If, despite reasonable precautions taken by us, circumstances beyond our control prevent the transfer from being completed.</li>
</ul>


<h3>13. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES:</h3>

<p>We may disclose information to third parties about your Deposit Account and the transfers you make as described in our Privacy Policy, which we may change, amend, or modify from time to time. You were provided the Privacy Policy when your Deposit Account was opened, and will be notified of any updates..</p>

<h3>14. IN CASE OF ERRORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS:</h3>

<p>Telephone us at 1-­888-­248-­0632 or send us a support message via the Web or Mobile Applications, as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt. We must hear from you no later than sixty (60) days after we sent you or made available to you the FIRST statement on which the error or problem appeared.</p>

<ol>
<li>Tell us your name and the account number for each Deposit Account.</li>
<li>Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe there is an error or why you need more information.</li>
<li>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error. If you tell us orally, we may require that you send your inquiry in writing within ten (10) business days. We will complete our investigation within ten (10) business days after we hear from you, and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, it may take up to forty­five (45) calendar days [ninety (90) calendar days for claims on accounts open less than thirty (30) calendar days, foreign­ initiated transaction claims, and point ­of ­sale transaction claims] to investigate your inquiry. If we decide to do this, we will provisionally re­credit your Account within ten (10) business days [twenty (20) business days for claims on Accounts open less than thirty (30) calendar days] for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your inquiry in writing and we do not receive such written inquiry within ten (10) business days, we may not provisionally re­ credit your Deposit Account. The time periods provided above may be extended as follows: <br><br>
  <ol>
  <li>For errors involving Deposit Accounts open less than thirty (30) calendar days, point-­of-­sale transactions, and foreign­initiated transactions, we may take up to ninety (90) days to investigate your complaint or inquiry.</li>
  <li>For new Accounts, we may take up to twenty (20) days to provisionally re­credit your Deposit Account.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
</ol>


<p> We will tell you the results of our investigation within three (3) business days of completing our investigation. If we find that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.</p>

<h3>15. CHANGES TO AND TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT:</h3>

<p>We may change the terms of this Agreement from time to time. These changes may include modifying or deleting existing terms and adding new terms. Any adverse modification or change, other than an immediate change necessary to maintain or restore the security of the Account or Compass ATM, or other network ATM in which we participate, shall take effect not less than twenty-­one (21) days after notice thereof has been mailed to your last address shown on our records, electronically if you have agreed to receive such notices electronically, or has been made available with the periodic statement of your Account (including electronic periodic statements). We may, but are not required to, give you notice if the amendment will be to your benefit. By retaining or using the Card or by authorizing anyone else to use the Card after the effective date of any change to this Agreement, you agree to that change. No change to any term or condition of this Agreement shall be effective unless accepted or authorized by us in writing. Either you or we may terminate this Agreement in its entirety at any time, but termination shall not affect any of your existing obligations under this Agreement. The Card is our property, is nontransferable and must be surrendered to us upon demand.</p>

<h3>16. CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH ATTORNEY’S FEES AND OTHER CHARGES MAY BE IMPOSED:</h3>

<p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, you shall be liable to us for all costs and damages resulting from any breach of this Agreement; provided, however, that your liability to us for unauthorized use of the Card shall be determined as provided in Section 14 above. If you fail to pay any amounts due under this Agreement and your debt is referred to an attorney(s), not one of our salaried employees for collection or other enforcement proceedings, whether by suit or otherwise, and the unpaid balance of the debt exceeds $300, you agree to pay all reasonable expenses permitted by applicable law, including but not limited to, court costs and attorney’s fees set by the court.</p>

<h3>17. GOVERNING LAW; SEVERABILITY:</h3>

<p>This Agreement and any claim, dispute or controversy arising from or relating to this Agreement, the Card, or any amounts contracted for, charged or received under this Agreement, whether based on contract, tort, fraud and other intentional torts, statute, regulation, constitution, common law and/or equity, are governed by the laws of the State of Alabama (without regard to internal principles of conflicts of law) and applicable federal law. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>

<h3>18. DISPUTE RESOLUTION:</h3>

<p>You agree that our issuance of the Card and performance of the related services provided under this Agreement take place in and substantially affect interstate commerce, and are irrevocably tied to your Deposit Accounts. You also agree that any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement shall be settled according to the terms provided in the Dispute Resolution Section of your Deposit Account Agreement, provided to you in connection with your deposit account(s). The terms and conditions of your Deposit Account Agreement are incorporated by reference into this Visa Card Agreement. YOUR ATTENTION IS DRAWN TO THE DISPUTES RESOLUTION SECTION OF YOUR DEPOSIT ACCOUNT AGREEMENT WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS VISA CARD AGREEMENT. THAT SECTION DESCRIBES ARBITRATION AND WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL PROVISIONS. IF A DISPUTE ARISES BETWEEN US, YOU OR WE MAY REQUIRE THAT IT BE RESOLVED THROUGH ARBITRATION RATHER THAN THROUGH A JURY TRIAL.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you reside in a state other than California, and we do not maintain your Deposit Account in California, the Dispute Resolution Section of the Deposit Account Agreement contains an arbitration provision that limits your ability to litigate claims in court and your right to jury trial. You should review this section of your Deposit Account Agreement carefully. You will not have the right to participate as a class representative or member of any class of claimants for any claim subject to arbitration. If you reside in California or we maintain your Deposit Account in California, the Dispute Resolution Section of the Deposit Account Agreement contains a judicial reference and waiver of jury trial provision that limits your
ability to litigate claims in court and your right to a jury trial. By agreeing to judicial reference, you and we waive, and shall not have, any right to a jury trial.</li>
</ul>
